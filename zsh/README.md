# ZSH

Think of Zsh as a more awesome bash without having to learn anything new.
Automatic spell correction for your commands, syntax highlighting, and more.
We've also provided lots of enhancements:

* Vim mode and bash style `Ctrl-R` for reverse history finder
* `Ctrl-x,Ctrl-l` to insert output of last command
* Fuzzy matching - if you mistype a directory name, tab completion will fix it
* [fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd) integration - hit `z` and partial match for recently used directory. Tab completion enabled.
* [Prezto - the power behind YADR's zsh](http://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)
* [How to add your own ZSH theme](doc/zsh/themes.md)

## Aliases

Lots of things we do every day are done with two or three character mnemonic aliases. Please feel free to edit them:

    ae # alias edit
    ar # alias reload
