# Tests

Right now we only test whether the installation process run from start to end without halting.

**IDEA:**

- Maybe we could add a step with https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck ?

**TODO:**

- [ ] Test the installation under linux. We can reuse the existing Dockerfile for that.
  - [ ] Update .travis.yml file
