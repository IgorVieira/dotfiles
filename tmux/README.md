# Tmux configuration

`tmux.conf` provides some sane defaults for tmux on Mac OS like a powerful status bar and vim keybindings.

You can customize the configuration in `~/.tmux.conf.user`.

Note: In order to have True Color support you must have tmux > 2.2 installed

# Learning Tmux

If you're new to tmux you can read their man page or a more palatable introduction as [this book](https://leanpub.com/the-tao-of-tmux/read).

Then make sure to see the bindings we customize in `tmux.conf` file.

You can also see bind available by typing: <kbd>Ctrl-b</kbd>-<kbd>?</kbd>
